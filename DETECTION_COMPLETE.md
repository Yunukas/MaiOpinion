# 🎉 Detection-Based Routing System - COMPLETE!

## ✅ Implementation Summary

Successfully refactored MaiOpinion to use a **detection-first architecture** with specialized diagnostic agents for different medical specialties!

---

## 🚀 What Changed

### Old Architecture (4 Agents)
```
Image → Generic Diagnostic → Reasoning → Treatment → Follow-Up
```

### New Architecture (5 Agents with Routing)
```
Image → Detection → Router → Specialized Diagnostic → Reasoning → Treatment → Follow-Up
                        ├─→ Dental Agent
                        ├─→ Chest X-ray Agent
                        └─→ Generic Agent (Brain, Skin, Bones, etc.)
```

## 🎨 Example Outputs

### Dental Case
```
🔍 IMAGE DETECTION
   Image Type: dental
   Body Part: teeth/oral cavity
   Imaging Modality: X-ray
   Detection Confidence: HIGH

🔍 FINDINGS
   Possible dental caries detected in upper molar region with visible decay.
   The affected tooth shows signs of enamel erosion and probable pulp
   involvement. Recommend immediate dental intervention.

💊 DIAGNOSIS
   Dental caries with pulpitis (Confidence: HIGH)
```

### Chest X-ray Case
```

   Image Type: chest_xray
   Body Part: lungs
   Imaging Modality: X-ray
   Detection Confidence: HIGH

🔍 FINDINGS
   Bilateral patchy infiltrates suggestive of pneumonia, with right-sided
   pleural effusion. Cardiac silhouette mildly enlarged. Mediastinal
   structures midline.

💊 DIAGNOSIS
   Pneumonia with pleural effusion (Confidence: HIGH)
```
